To compile all seven algorithms run the test method. The testmethod.py will print out a graph plotting all seven methods as well as their absolute error and the method itself. 

 Numerical Experiments

You will need to demonstrate the performance of the methods on severla example IVP. To show the performance it is often better to use figures than tables. For example you can show the result of RK4. To plot use the plot |wi -yi|, the error of estimate wi to true solution yi = y(ti), instead of actual yi and wi. This way you can see which methods have lower errors higher accuracy.
